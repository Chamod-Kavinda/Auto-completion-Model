    "We will train a RNN to suggest possible autocompletes given $3$ - $4$ starting letters. That is if we input a string \"univ\" hopefully we expect to see an output like \"university\", \"universal\" etc.\n",

Although the letters in our case are not treated as categorical data, the same reasons as for categorical data is applicable.

    "\n",
    "Converting letters into numbers based on their alphabetical order (such as 'a' -> 1, 'b' -> 2, etc.) is indeed a bad way to encode letters for a learning model. This is because there is no meaningful relationship between the numerical values assigned to the letters. For example, just because 'a' is assigned 1 and 'b' is assigned 2, it doesn’t mean that 'b' is \"greater\" or \"closer\" to 'a' in any meaningful way for a machine learning model. This is the same problem we encounter with categorical data: categories like \"apple\" and \"orange\" shouldn’t have a natural order like numbers do, so simply assigning them numbers can mislead the model into thinking that there is some kind of relationship between these numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though this claim is valid, it won't be an issue in our case because we will use something called an embedding layer. An embedding layer maps each letter to a dense vector in a continuous space. These vectors are learned during training, and they help the model understand relationships between letters in a more meaningful way. For example, letters that often appear together in words will have vectors that are closer to each other, while letters that don’t have much in common will have vectors that are farther apart.\n",

    "\"univ\" → \"universe_________\"\n",
    "The completion of \"univ\" to \"universe\" is accurate and relevant, suggesting the model learned the correct continuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"math\" → \"mathelled________\"\n",
    "This result is less satisfactory. \"Mathelled\" is not a valid word, and the model might be struggling to find a familiar continuation for \"math.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"neur\" → \"neural___________\"\n",
    "\"Neural\" is a valid word and a correct prediction. The model likely learned medical or biological terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"engin\" → \"engineer__________\"\n",
    "\"Engineer\" is a sensible completion and correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"equa\" → \"equal____________\"\n",
    "\"Equal\" is a correct and valid word completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"exce\" → \"excellent________\"\n",
    "\"Excellent\" is another correct prediction, which is highly relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"impr\" → \"improvings_______\"\n",
    "The prefix \"impr\" is correctly continued with \"improvings,\" though this is grammatically incorrect. It might have been expected to generate \"improvement\" or \"improving.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"gener\" → \"general___________\"\n",
    "\"General\" is a common and valid word completion.\n",

    "Suggestions for Improvement\n",
    "- Train longer: Increase the number of training epochs to help the model learn better word patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improve training data: Use a larger and more varied dataset to help the model predict words more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use pretrained embeddings: Try using word embeddings like GloVe or FastText, which already know many words and their meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add dropout: Include dropout layers in the model to prevent it from memorizing specific patterns and help it generalize better.\n",
